        <h1>A/B MACHINES</h1>
        <p>adapted from the work of Andy Warhol<br>created and directed by Philip Wesley Gates<br>Philadelphia Fringe Festival 2020</p>
        <p>Welcome, public! Tonight you will get a glimpse into the life and routine of three very glamorous and important individuals. Our superstars are so thrilled you’ll be joining them.</p>
        <p>We invite you to get into a LOOK for the performance — whatever that means to you! Remember going out to a show and looking cute? Imagine we’re all in a theatre lobby together, chatting, laughing, maybe having a preshow drink, maybe checking each other out…</p>
        <p>Once you’ve got yourself ready, there will be a chance for you to share a selfie before the show — no pressure, you can enjoy the performance without doing so if you prefer. But we’d love to see all of your faces — and you just might make a guest star appearance!</p>
